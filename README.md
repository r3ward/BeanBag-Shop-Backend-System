# O-O-Pair-Programming

It is an expectation that pairs have at a minimum four
pair-programming sessions in the first week of release of the CA.

One (the driver ) physically writes the
code while the other (the observer ) reviews each line of code as it is generated. During
the development, the roles are switched between the two programmers frequently. The
aim of the split role is for the two programmers to concern themselves with different
aspects of the software being developed, with the observer considering the strategic
direction of the work (how it fits with the whole, and the deliverables), and the driver
principally focussed on tactical aspects of the current task at hand (block, method,
class, etc.), as well as allowing useful discussion between the developers regarding
different possible solutions and design approaches.
